   MAX303CPE
          Dual high-speed analog switches
          The single-pole double-throw (SPDT) MAX303 has two normally open
          (NO) and two normally closed (NC) poles.
          The switches operate with a single positive supply (+10V to
          +30V) or with split supplies (±4.5V to ±20V) while retaining
          CMOS-logic input compatibility and fast switching.

   MAX31865
          RTD to Digital Converter
          The MAX31865 is a resistance-to-digital converter optimized for
          platinum resistance temperature detectors (RTDs).
          An external resistor sets the sensitivity for the RTD being used
          and a delta-sigma ADC converts the ratio of the RTD resistance
          to the reference resistance into digital form. The MAX31865’s
          inputs are protected against overvoltage faults up to +/-50V.
          Programmable detection of RTD and cable open and short
          conditions is included.
